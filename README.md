# Machine-Learning-Credit-Score-Analysis

## Credit Score Analysis and Loan Eligibility Prediction

##  Objective

Develop an interactive machine learning model to analyze credit scores and other financial information to predict personal loan eligibility.

# Approach 

Collect datasets containing credit scores, income, employment history, and other relevant financial information. Clean and preprocess the data using Pandas, then use Scikit-learn to train classification models. Visualize the analysis using Matplotlip.

## Python Script

* Initialize, train, and evaluate the model.
* Clean, normalize, and standardize the data before modeling.
* Utilize data retrieved from Spark.


## Data Model Implementation

* Model is interactive showing likelyhood of loan elegibility judging by various categories such as "Income," "Age," "Years of experience," "State," "Home owner/ Renter," "Married and Single."
* The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power, achieving 89% classification accuracy, an R1 Score of: 0.013263271631139717, and an R2 Score of: 0.010517237223139792.


## Data Sources

Public datasets from financial institutions, Kaggle datasets on credit scores containing credit scores and financial histories.

## Ethical Considerations

When looking and picking our data, our team made sure to maintain integrity and made sure we remain compliant with all the laws and regulations for each data site. We made sure our data resources were for public use and stayed complient with the data extraction policies. Since our data was extracted from Kaggle, a community platform that contains data free for public use, we obtained consent by agreeing to the site's terms and conditions.  

## Technologies

* Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.
* Python Pandas for data manipulation, and for data visualization.
