# Machine-Learning-Credit-Score-Analysis

## Credit Score Analysis and Loan Eligibility Prediction

### Objective: 
Develop a machine learning model to analyze credit scores and other financial information to predict personal loan eligibility.

### Data Sources: 
Public datasets from financial institutions, Kaggle datasets on credit scores containing credit scores and financial histories.

### Technologies: 
Use Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, Python Pandas for data manipulation, and for data visualization.

# Approach: 
Collect datasets containing credit scores, income, employment history, and other relevant financial information. Clean and preprocess the data using Pandas, then use Scikit-learn to train classification models. Visualize the analysis using Matplotlip.
